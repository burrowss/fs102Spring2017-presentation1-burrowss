# fs102Spring2017-presentation1-burrowss

This repository contains the beginning of a presentation for my spring seminar class at Allegheny College. It originally was from: https://github.com/gkapfham/seke2015-panel-presentation

But Professor Gregory Kapfhammer has allowed access and use of this repository for others to use.

## Installation Instructions

First fork this repository from : https://github.com/gkapfham/seke2015-panel-presentation

Then you can rename the repository so that it matches your desired name. Following that, clone the repository to your local machine.
It will copy the files into your local repository.

Please note that the presentation uses local fonts so that it can be displayed at a conference on a laptop that either
may not have access to the Internet or may only have unreliable Internet access. Some browsers may disallow the loading
of local fonts due to security reasons. However, it should be possible for you to view the presentation correctly when
using Chrome or Chromium on the Ubuntu operating system &mdash;
